# WIZARD FIGHT
### [Proof of Concept]
#### Tactical RPG

[**Wizard Fight**](https://github.com/mperez68/WizardFight) started as a Unity project but has since been adapted to Godot Engine. The game is a tactical RPG based around cartoon wizards throwing fireballs and lightning bolts. Except some basic spell icons, all assets, including music, were made by me. This project made me realize how much work I need to do on my pixel art but also made me very proud of my music production. The game can be played [here](https://github.com/mperez68/WizardFight/blob/5ade6d3eaece5580d9f5c72d65633402cc8d62d8/Wizard%20Fight.zip) and the soundtrack can be found [here](https://on.soundcloud.com/RWVdwBi6JeSSRrJY9).
